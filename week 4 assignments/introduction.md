# Business Problem
Toronto, Ontario is one of the most populated areas in Canada. Toronto was once called the land of opportunity, which brought in a variety of people from different ethnic backgrounds to the core city of Canada. "Toronto is an international centre of business, finace, arts and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world." - Robert Vipond (04/11/2017)

Being the largest city in Canada with an estimated population of just over 6 million in 2021, there is no doubt about the diversity of the population. Multiculturalism is seen through the various neighbourhoods including; Chinatown, Corso Italia, Little India, Kensington Market, Little Italy, Koreatown and many more. 

Downtown Toronto, like the downtown centre of any major area, is the hub of interactions between ethnicities which bring opportunities for entrepreneurs to start or grow their business and dreams. It is a place where people can try the best of each culture, either while they work or just passing through. Toronto is most notably known for its food, as it is an important part of life and culture in this area.

The objective of this project is to use Foursquare location data and regional clustering of venue information to determine what might be the ‘best’ neighbourhood in Toronto to open a restaurant. Pizza and Pasta are one of the most bought dishes in Toronto originating from Italy. Toronto is the fourth largest home to Italians with a population of over 500k, there are numerous opportunities to open a new Italian restaurant. Through purpose of this project is to find an optimal location for a new italian business owner to open his family restaurant. 

# Target Audience
Entrepreneurs who are passionate about opening a italian restaurant in a metropolitan city would be very interested in this project. The project is also for business owners and stakeholders who want to expand their businesses and wonder how data science could be applied to the questions at hand.
