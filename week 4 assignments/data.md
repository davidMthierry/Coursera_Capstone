# Data 
The data that will be required will be a combination of CSV files that have been prepared for the purposes of the analysis from multiple sources which will provide the list of neighborhoods in Toronto (via Wikipedia), the geographical locations of the neighborhoods (originally via geocoder, since deprecated, instead via a given dataset from coursera) and Venue data pertaining to Italian restaurants (via Foursquare). The Venue data will help find which neighbourhood is best suitable to open an Italian restaurant.
